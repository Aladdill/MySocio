This is the readme file for the LJToolkit 0.6.0
================================================

--- Version 0.6.0 ---
* Fixed a packaging problem in the build xml when building the ljtoolkit.jar.
* Added a reference implementation client for the ljtoolkit library.
* Added CLIENT file that describes the use of the reference implementation.
 
--- Version 0.5.0 ---

- This happens to be the first publicly released version of the API and the version number is arbitrary.
However, the number does represent software beyond alpha but still in beta condition. This is using version
1.0.0 as a benchmark for something that's useful for non-trivial applications.

- This first release is aimed and providing the interfaces and implementations to interact with the Live Journal
server via the flat client/server protocol. Interfaces and implementations have been created for all of the services
called out in the "Flat Client/Server Protocol Reference". An online version of the reference can be found at
http://www.livejournal.com/doc/server/ljp.csp.flat.protocol.html

- Version 0.5.0 depends on the following jars
  commons-codec-1.3
  commons-collections
  commons-httpclient-3.1-rc1
  commons-lang
  commons-logging
  log4j-1.2.13
  testng-5.5-jdk15

- The future road map to version 1.0.0 will be the following
  1. Complete rigorous unit test suite that covers 'most' use cases.
  2. Shore up implementation gaps derived from 1.
  3. Tidy up JavaDocs.
  4. Complete functional testing by using in a reference application.
  
 - NOTE: To run the unit tests change the values in test/org/ljtoolkit/services/ resources.properties to the those
 of the user.
 
 - LJClient: The user should also be aware of a reference implementation (LJClient) which provides a command line
 interface for add/update/delete and listing of Live Journal events.
