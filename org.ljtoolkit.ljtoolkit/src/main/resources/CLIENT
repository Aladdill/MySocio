This is the client file for the LJToolkit 0.6.0
================================================

===== Intro =====
There is a small but serviceable reference implementation of a command line tool
for the LJToolkit distribution. The source can be found in the org.ljtoolkit.client
package. The client provides the ablility to add/update/delete and fetch a listing
of the user's Live Journal events. There are a couple of different ways to run the
client.

==== Running Client =====
1.) Goto the ljtoolkit/lib directory and issue the following command: 
	
java -jar ljtoolkit.jar -h

Of course this assumes that java is in your path. In order to do anything useful the
user will have to enter -u username -p password on the command line for all commands
but help. This can make for a lot of typing so the following option is prefferable.

2.) Create a system environment variable LJTOOLKIT_HOME and then add the following to
your system PATH environment variable:

%LJTOOLKIT_HOME%\bin

There is an ljclient bat file in the bin directory where the user can enter their
username and password. At the point the user should be able to run 'ljclient -h' from
anywhere in the command shell.

The batch file should work for Windows NT/2000/XP. Anyone that would like to contribute
working batch files or shell scripts for other operating systems is more than welcome.

In addition to the ljclient.bat file there are a number of convienence batch files which
restrict the number of command line options that are needed.

==== Adding and Updating an Entry =====
This should give you the command line. For adding and updating actions an input file
needs to be provided with the content for adding or updating. The format of that file
is as follows:

Title: Some title goes here
Security: Security tag goes here (PUBLIC/PRIVATE)
Tags: Some comma delimeted tags go here (foo, bar, baz)

Contents of post go here

From the above example the following rules apply:
	- The first line MUST have Title:
	- The second line MUST have Security:
	- The third line MUST have Tags:
	- The contents of the post range from the fifth line to eof.

The contents of the post can have all the html that Live Journal excepts for an event.
